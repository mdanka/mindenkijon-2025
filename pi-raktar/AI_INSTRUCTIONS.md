There is a small game/puzzle where we need to find the shortest path to a solution.

The game's board consists of 11 squares/nodes. Let's index them from 0 to 10. They are adjacent/connected (bidirectionally) in the following way: 0 to 1, 1 to 2, 2 to 4, 4 to 3 and 5, 5 to 6, 6 to 7 and 8, 8 to 9, 9 to 10.

Each of the squares is either empty (let's mark it with 0), or has a green box (mark with 1), or a brown box (mark with 2).

When visualising in text, draw it as the following. For example, the state 11100000222 would be:

00000
 1 2 
11 22

So the indexes are:

03 04 05 06 07
   02    08    
00 01    09 10

In one move, we can lift any one box and move it to any one empty space, provided that the path to the space is empty. For example, in the example state above, we can move from square 2 to 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 (all of these counts as just one step), but we cannot move from square 1 to anywhere.

Our goal is to get from 11100000222 to 22200000111 in the shortest number of steps.

In order to find the shortest path, let's follow the following algorithm.

1. Let's create a map that maps states to 1) the minimum number of steps required to get from there to the final state of 22200000111 2) which state we need to go there from to get that minimum.
2. Initially this map contains a single state, 22200000111, mapped to 0, as there are no steps necessary from there to get to there, and there are no next steps.
3. Let's also have a processing queue for states that we need to backtrack from. Initially this only contains 22200000111.
4. In each iteration, let's take the oldest element of the queue. From the queue, find all potential next states (that make sure that boxes don't cross each other). For each of these states, if we haven't got there before, make the steps there as 1 plus the steps to the current state, and mark the next step there as the current state. Also add this new state to the queue. If we have already got to a given state before, then that path was shortest, so don't overwrite it.
5. Repeat until the queue is empty.

Once this is done, we have the shortest path from each state to our final state. Make sure to serialise this information to a text file. Then take the start state of 11100000222, and construct the shortest path to 22200000111. Finally, visualise this using the method described earlier, and serialise this to a text file as well.

```
It would have had to reach the start state too, so something must be incorrect
```

```
That is incorrect. We should not be able to move through boxes of the same type!
```

```
The visualisation doesn't look correct:
The second row should have just one starting space and one middle space
The third row should have a single middle space

Also, this has 16 states but it's 15 steps
```

```
1. Add a README.md that includes how to run the solver and how to interpret the result files.
2. Move the whole thing into a folder called pi-raktar
```

```
Move the output files to the subfolder as well
```

```
Now run the code to confirm it works
