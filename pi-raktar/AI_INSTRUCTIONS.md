There is a small game/puzzle where we need to find the shortest path to a solution.

The game's board consists of 11 squares/nodes. Let's index them from 0 to 10. They are adjacent/connected (bidirectionally) in the following way: 0 to 1, 1 to 2, 2 to 4, 4 to 3 and 5, 5 to 6, 6 to 7 and 8, 8 to 9, 9 to 10.

Each of the squares is either empty (let's mark it with 0), or has a green box (mark with 1), or a brown box (mark with 2).

When visualising in text, draw it as the following. For example, the state 11100000222 would be:

00000
 1 2 
11 22

So the indexes are:

03 04 05 06 07
   02    08    
00 01    09 10

In one move, we can lift any one box and move it to any one empty space, provided that the path to the space is empty. For example, in the example state above, we can move from square 2 to 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 (all of these counts as just one step), but we cannot move from square 1 to anywhere.

Our goal is to get from 11100000222 to 22200000111 in the shortest number of steps.

In order to find the shortest path, let's follow the following algorithm.

1. Let's create a map that maps states to 1) the minimum number of steps required to get from there to the final state of 22200000111 2) which state we need to go there from to get that minimum.
2. Initially this map contains a single state, 22200000111, mapped to 0, as there are no steps necessary from there to get to there, and there are no next steps.
3. Let's also have a processing queue for states that we need to backtrack from. Initially this only contains 22200000111.
4. In each iteration, let's take the oldest element of the queue. From the queue, find all potential next states (that make sure that boxes don't cross each other). For each of these states, if we haven't got there before, make the steps there as 1 plus the steps to the current state, and mark the next step there as the current state. Also add this new state to the queue. If we have already got to a given state before, then that path was shortest, so don't overwrite it.
5. Repeat until the queue is empty.

Once this is done, we have the shortest path from each state to our final state. Make sure to serialise this information to a text file. Then take the start state of 11100000222, and construct the shortest path to 22200000111. Finally, visualise this using the method described earlier, and serialise this to a text file as well.

I'll help you create a Python script to solve this puzzle and find the shortest path. Let me break this down into steps and create the necessary code.
First, I'll create a Python script that implements this algorithm. I'll need to:
Define the board structure and connections
Implement state representation and validation
Create the BFS algorithm to find shortest paths
Add visualization functions
Save the results to files
Let me create this script:
I've created a Python script that implements the puzzle solver according to your specifications. Let me explain the key components:
The CONNECTIONS dictionary defines the bidirectional connections between squares on the board.
Key functions:
is_valid_state: Validates state strings
get_possible_moves: Finds all legal moves from a given state
is_path_clear: Checks if there's a clear path between two positions
apply_move: Applies a move to a state
visualize_state: Creates the text visualization of a state
find_shortest_paths: Main function that implements the BFS algorithm
The algorithm works by:
Starting from the final state (22200000111)
Using BFS to explore all possible previous states
Recording the minimum steps and next state for each state found
Saving the complete state map to state_map.json
Finding and saving the shortest path from start to final state in shortest_path.txt
Let's run the script to find the solution:
I see there's an error in the script. The issue is that we're trying to find the path from the start state before we've actually found it in our BFS. Let me fix this by modifying the script to ensure we find the start state:
```

```
It would have had to reach the start state too, so something must be incorrect
```

```
That is incorrect. We should not be able to move through boxes of the same type!
```

```
The visualisation doesn't look correct:
The second row should have just one starting space and one middle space
The third row should have a single middle space

Also, this has 16 states but it's 15 steps
```

```
1. Add a README.md that includes how to run the solver and how to interpret the result files.
2. Move the whole thing into a folder called pi-raktar
```

```
Move the output files to the subfolder as well
```

```
Now run the code to confirm it works
